            <h1>Final project proposal</h1>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Root & Rind </p><!--Change it to the name of the company-->
            
            <p>Root & Rind is an all organic, locally grown smoothie and acai juice bar. They sell a variety of smoothies and bowls along with some snacks. Located in downtown San Luis Obispo, catered towards students. There are places to study along with some small goods to shop for. For example, jewelry, postcards, mugs, pens/pencils, and various knick knacks. </p><!--Short description of the company-->
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Root & Rind is geared toward the college population in San Luis Obispo but also target middle class residents in the area. We are mainly looking for young adults, since smoothies and bowls are very popular around their age demographic. Due to it being a locally sourced cafe, prices will vary, so the target is lower to middle class. </p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
           
            <p>Root & Rind's goal is to create a great atmosphere for young adults to come, grab a bite to eat and either shop around or stay to study or get work done.  </p><!-- What are their primary task and goals? -->
