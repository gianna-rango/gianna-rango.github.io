        <h1>Sabon vs. Times New Roman </h1>
             <h2>History of Sabon and Times New Roman</h2>


			 <h3>Sabon—1967, Jan Tschichold</h3>
			 <h4>Sabon was designed by German typographer Jan Tschichold beginning in 1964 and released in 1967. It was produced by three foundries, D. Stempel AG, Linotype, and Monotype. It was created so it could be used by the three types of metal type printers, foundry type for hand composition, linecasting, and single-type machine composition.Tschichold’s used 16th century typefaces as inspiration, with Sabon’s design being connected to Garamond roots. The typeface is named after Jakob Sabon, who was the student of French punchcutter Claude Garamond. Sabon completed a set of Garamond’s punches after his death and eventually went on to become owner of a German foundry. When Sabon died in 1580, his widow, daughter of printer Christian Egenolff, remarried Konrad Berner, who took over the foundry. Tschichold based the design of Sabon from a specimen sheet released by the Egenolff-Berner foundry: a 14 point roman accredited to Claude Garamond and an italic accredited to Robert Granjon. The name Sabon was chosen to distinguish the typeface from the names Garamond and Granjon. 

				Sabon is an old-style serif typeface. Sabon is described as classic, elegant, and particularly legible—making it an excellent choice for text in book and magazine design. As for some of the specifics, Sabon has a generous x-height, bracketed serifs, short descenders, the characters end at an angle, and some characters have ball terminals.

			 <h3>Times New Roman—1932, Stanley Morison</h3>
             
			 <h4>Times New Roman first appeared in 1932 in the London newspaper, The Times. Originally, The Times faced criticism for its outdated typographic choices by respected type designer Stanley Morison, of the English branch of Monotype. In response, the newspaper asked for Morison to create a better typeface for them. The current typeface of the newspaper was titled “Times Old Roman” so the new typeface was debuted in 1932 and called “Times New Roman”. Morison utilized the help of draftsmen Victor Lardent, from the advertising department of The Times, and the two began creating a typeface that focused on efficiency (maximizing the amount of type of a page to be economical) and readability (so reading could be easier on the viewer’s eyes). Morision took inspiration from the typeface Plantin, which was based on the 16th century typeface Gros Cicero, designed by Robert Granjon. The font quickly became popular since it was being used in a daily newspaper. It became offered as a commercial font in 1933 and quickly took off thanks to its legibility and style. It began as a monotype and linotype font and was later translated to digital and phototype. It has remained popular over the years and  is the standard for many platforms and formats today. 


				Times New Roman is an old-style serif typeface. Morison made specific modifications to the characters, so that the typeface would serve its intended purpose for its commissioner. The typeface has a raised x-height, shorter descenders, and narrow tracking, for a more condensed look. This allows for tighter line space, so more lines/text can fit on each pageIt also has large counters and apertures, its ball terminal creates a larger contrast between the strokes. Morison altered the shape of the characters so when printed, that the letters would hold more ink and appear darker.
